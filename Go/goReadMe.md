## Go ReadMe

5.09.22 After installing Go, following [this](https://go.dev/) tutorial, I learned how to run a go program.

```go run <filename>```

I created a file called `goPlayground.go` and ran it. :D

```Go
    package main
    import ("fmt")
    
    func main() {
    	fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
    	}
```
Which outputs:
> "Hello, World!"
